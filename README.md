# Rayzee - Path Tracer Web Application
Welcome to Rayzee, a realtime path tracing web application! Rayzee brings the power of physically accurate light simulation to the web, allowing users to experience advanced rendering techniques directly in their browsers. Built using **Three.js, GLSL shaders,** and **React**, Rayzee is designed for high-quality visual output and interactive performance.

#### What is Path Tracing?
Path tracing is a global illumination algorithm that simulates how light interacts with objects in a scene. By tracing the paths of light rays as they bounce around, path tracing generates photorealistic images with accurate shadows, reflections, refractions, and indirect lighting. It's a widely used technique in the film and gaming industries for producing realistic renders.

#### Key Features
- **Advanced Path Tracing Engine:** Physically-accurate global illumination with support for complex materials, caustics, and multi-bounce light transport
- **AI-Powered Denoising:** Intel Open Image Denoise (OIDN) and ASVGF temporal denoising for clean, artifact-free renders
- **Adaptive Sampling & Variance Estimation:** Intelligently distributes samples where needed most, dramatically improving convergence speed
- **Real-time Interactive Rendering:** Seamless transition between interactive navigation and high-quality final renders
- **Photorealistic Materials:** Full PBR workflow with support for metals, glass, subsurface scattering, and complex BRDFs
- **Production-Quality Camera Simulation:** Accurate depth of field, aperture control, and realistic camera response
- **Acceleration Structures:** High-performance BVH (Bounding Volume Hierarchy) for efficient ray-scene intersection
- **Advanced Post-Processing:** Bloom, tone mapping, and exposure control for professional-grade output
- **HDR Environment Lighting:** Image-based lighting with importance sampling for realistic environmental illumination
- **Modern UI & Visualization Tools:** Interactive parameter controls with real-time feedback and debug visualization

#### Technologies Used
- **Three.js:** For 3D rendering and scene management.
- **GLSL:** To implement the core path tracing logic in the fragment shader.
- **React:** For creating the applicationâ€™s interactive user interface.
- **Vite:** A fast and modern build tool for development and optimization.

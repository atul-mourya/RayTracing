## What is Path Tracing?

Path tracing is a rendering technique that simulates the physical behavior of light by tracing rays as they bounce through a scene. This approach produces photorealistic images with accurate:
- Global illumination and indirect lighting
- Realistic shadows and reflections  
- Complex material interactions
- Caustics and light scattering effects

## ✨ Key Features

### 🚀 Advanced Rendering Engine
- **Real-time Path Tracing**: GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo path tracing with WebGL shaders
- **Adaptive Sampling**: Intelligent sample distribution with variance-guided quality control
- **Progressive Rendering**: Continuous quality improvement with accumulation buffer
- **Multi-bounce Transport**: Configurable bounce limits for complex light interactions
- **Tiled Rendering**: Efficient progressive refinement with tile-based processing

### 🎨 Visual Quality Features
- **AI-Powered Denoising**: Intel OIDN integration for clean, artifact-free renders
- **ASVGF Temporal Filtering**: Advanced spatiotemporal noise reduction
- **HDR Environment Mapping**: Image-based lighting with importance sampling
- **Advanced Tone Mapping**: Multiple tone mapping operators (ACES, AgX, Reinhard, etc.)
- **Post-Processing Pipeline**: Bloom, exposure control, and color grading
- **Depth of Field**: Realistic camera simulation with focus controls

4. **Camera Control**: Use mouse to navigate, or switch between embedded cameras from loaded models
5. **Material Editing**: Select objects in the outliner to modify PBR material properties
6. **Progressive Rendering**: Watch the path tracer continuously improve image quality over time
7. **Results Management**: Save, organize, and post-process your rendered images

### 📸 Working with Results

**Rendering & Saving:**
- Configure final render settings in the "Final Render" panel (resolution, samples, denoising)
- Choose between Regular or Tiled rendering modes for different quality/performance trade-offs  
- Save completed renders automatically to the local database with timestamp and metadata
- Access saved renders anytime from the Results panel in the left sidebar

**Results Gallery:**
- Browse all saved renders in a grid layout with thumbnail previews
- View detailed render information including date/time and technical settings
- Delete unwanted renders with one-click removal
- Select any render to view in full resolution in the Results viewport

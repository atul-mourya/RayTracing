RayTracing Project TODO
=======================

üêõ Bugs & Issues
----------------

- [ ]  some meshes in outliner shows as group and i'm not able to activate material editor ( example bistro )
- [ ]  when switching to render mode, ongoing denoising process should be cancelled
- [ ]  transparent true or false makes no difference

BVH Construction Improvements
-----------------------------
- [ ]  BVH update / refit - https://claude.ai/share/e55132c8-758a-4117-b5ae-04d73e67351b
- [ ]  Experiment with 4-way branching for GPU traversal
- [ ]  Consider PLOC only if you need maximum performance and can invest in the more complex implementation

üîÑ Major Refactoring
--------------------

- [ ]  Develop WebGPU version using TSL
    -   Reference: <https://github.com/gnikoloff/webgpu-raytracer>
- [ ]  Implement offscreen canvas rendering for non-blocking UI

üöÄ Hybrid Rendering Implementation Plan
---------------------------------------

1.  Initial Render
    - [ ]  Implement rasterization-based first pass
    - [ ]  Set up initial scene representation
2.  Low-Resolution Path Tracing
    - [ ]  Implement quick low-res path tracing
    - [ ]  Set up blending with rasterized version
3.  High-Resolution Path Tracing
    - [ ]  Progressive refinement system
    - [ ]  Sample computation optimization
4.  Blending System
    - [ ]  Implement gradual blend between renders
    - [ ]  Quality-based transition controls

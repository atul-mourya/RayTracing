# Rayzee Path Tracer - TODO List
*Immediate actionable items and development tasks*

## ï¿½ Critical Bug Fixes

### Known Issues
- [ ] some meshes in outliner shows as group and i'm not able to activate material editor (example bistro)
- [ ] after each tile rendering cycle, the rendered image is becomes dim/low quality

### Code Quality & Performance
- [ ] **Performance Profiling**
  - [ ] GPU timing measurements
  - [ ] Memory usage tracking
  - [ ] Bottleneck identification
  - [ ] Performance regression tests

- [ ] **Code Organization**
  - [ ] Comprehensive test suite
  - [ ] Shader code architecture documentation.

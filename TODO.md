=======================

üêõ Bugs & Issues
----------------

- [ ]  Fix transmission value changes not impacting transmission intensity
- [ ]  active catalog item not being highlighted in the UI

‚ú® Core Features
---------------

- [ ]  Transparent background support
- [ ]  Subsurface scattering implementation
- [ ]  Auto focus based on object distance
- [ ]  Volumetric rendering
- [ ]  Caustic support
- [ ]  Custom environment map support
- [ ]  Auto exposure control - https://x.com/chriskwallis/status/1817041601274708240
- [ ]  implement support for point light
- [ ]  implement support for spot light

- [ ]  introduce tessalation free displacement mapping
- [ ]  implement support for bumpmap
- [ ]  Implement SDF-based model rendering
- [ ]  Implement Dynamic BVH update


üîß Performance Improvements
---------------------------

- [ ]  improve light sampling as it is too slow - specially for area lights
- [ ]  Implement offscreen canvas rendering - https://threejs.org/manual/#en/offscreencanvas
- [ ]  Refactor lights to use data texture instead of uniform buffer
- [ ]  experiment with leveraging primary ray from rasterization pass for path tracing
- [ ]  experiment with ray frustum culling
- [ ]  refactor path tracing to use to use define instead of if-else

üé® UI Enhancements
------------------

- [ ]  Add dynamic lights addition and removal
- [ ]  Add dynamic camera addition and removal
- [ ]  Add dynamic object addition and removal
- [ ]  improve focus control - https://x.com/thefrontendcat/status/1885422008344903980

üîÑ Major Refactoring
--------------------

- [ ]  Develop WebGPU version using TSL
    -   Reference: <https://github.com/gnikoloff/webgpu-raytracer>
- [ ]  Implement offscreen canvas rendering for non-blocking UI

üöÄ Hybrid Rendering Implementation Plan
---------------------------------------

1.  Initial Render
    - [ ]  Implement rasterization-based first pass
    - [ ]  Set up initial scene representation
2.  Low-Resolution Path Tracing
    - [ ]  Implement quick low-res path tracing
    - [ ]  Set up blending with rasterized version
3.  High-Resolution Path Tracing
    - [ ]  Progressive refinement system
    - [ ]  Sample computation optimization
4.  Blending System
    - [ ]  Implement gradual blend between renders
    - [ ]  Quality-based transition controls

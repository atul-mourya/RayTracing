RayTracing Project TODO
=======================

üêõ Bugs & Issues
----------------

- [ ]  active catalog item not being highlighted in the UI
- [ ]  drag and drop models retriggers the rendering blocking the UI and bvh generation delay
- [ ]  on model load, the canvas size changes
- [ ]  some meshes in outliner shows as group and i'm not able to activate material editor ( example bistro )
- [ ]  fullscreen canvas not working

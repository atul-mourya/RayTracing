‚ú® Core Features
---------------

- [ ]  Transparent background support
- [ ]  Subsurface scattering implementation
- [ ]  Volumetric rendering
- [ ]  Caustic support
- [ ]  Auto exposure control - https://x.com/chriskwallis/status/1817041601274708240

üîÑ Major Refactoring
--------------------

- [ ]  Develop WebGPU version using TSL
    -   Reference: <https://github.com/gnikoloff/webgpu-raytracer>
- [ ]  Implement offscreen canvas rendering for non-blocking UI

üöÄ Hybrid Rendering Implementation Plan
---------------------------------------

1.  Initial Render
    - [ ]  Implement rasterization-based first pass
    - [ ]  Set up initial scene representation
2.  Low-Resolution Path Tracing
    - [ ]  Implement quick low-res path tracing
    - [ ]  Set up blending with rasterized version
3.  High-Resolution Path Tracing
    - [ ]  Progressive refinement system
    - [ ]  Sample computation optimization
4.  Blending System
    - [ ]  Implement gradual blend between renders
    - [ ]  Quality-based transition controls

# Wavefront Path Tracing — Implementation Status & TODO

> **Status (2026-05):** the wavefront path tracer is now the **sole renderer** — the megakernel
> ("monolithic") has been fully removed (no `wavefrontEnabled` flag; no two-renderer code path).
> The sole renderer is `Stages/PathTracer.js` (`class PathTracer extends PathTracerStage`); kernels
> live in `TSL/`; the kernel manager is `Processor/KernelManager.js`. References to "monolithic"
> below are historical (porting notes). See `docs/PATH_TRACER_SHADER_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## What's Built

### Architecture (fully working)
- Compute kernels dispatched per frame in a CPU-driven bounce loop (Generate → per-bounce
  [Extend → (Sort) → Shade → Compact] → FinalWrite; DebugKernel for visMode)
- **SoA packed buffers** (1 storage buffer binding per data category) solving the 8-binding limit
- `PathTracer` extends `PathTracerStage` — identical context textures + events

### Kernel Pipeline (per frame)
```
resetCounters → Generate → initActiveIndices
  for each bounce:
    Extend → resetShadowCounter → Shade → Connect → Accumulate → resetActiveCounter → Compact → swap
FinalWrite → copyToReadTargets → publishToContext
```

### What Each Kernel Does
| Kernel | WG Size | Bindings | Status |
|--------|---------|----------|--------|
| **Generate** | 16×16 | 2 | Complete — DOF, jitter, adaptive sampling |
| **Extend** | 256×1 | 6 | Complete — calls `traverseBVH()` directly |
| **Shade** | 256×1 | 8 (at limit) | Partial — see gaps below |
| **Connect** | 256×1 | 6 | Complete — opaque-only shadows |
| **Accumulate** | 256×1 | 4 | Complete — scatter-add to parent ray |
| **Compact** | 256×1 | 4 | Complete — atomic append |
| **FinalWrite** | 16×16 | 1+tex | Complete — temporal accumulation |
| Reset kernels ×3 | 1×1 | 1 | Complete |
| InitActiveIndices | 256×1 | 1 | Complete |

### Bugs Fixed After Initial Integration (2026-04-19)

- **Environment change didn't update wavefront render** — `_buildWavefrontKernels` creates INDEPENDENT texture nodes (comment: "avoids Three.js TextureNode caching issues between monolithic and wavefront compute pipelines"). When `EnvironmentManager.setEnvironmentMap()` ran, it updated the monolithic's `envTex.value` but the wavefront's `freshEnvTex` stayed pinned to the old texture. **Fix**: save the fresh texture nodes as `this._wfTexNodes` and refresh their `.value` each frame in `render()` via `_refreshWfTextureNodes()`. Same pattern applies preemptively to material texture arrays — cheap since TextureNode `.value = sameRef` is a no-op. Verified: loading a new HDRI while in wavefront mode now updates backdrop + reflections within 1 frame.

### Key Bugs Fixed During Implementation
1. **`storage(attr, 'vec4', count)` with count>0** creates separate GPU buffers per node. Must use `count=0` so RW/RO nodes share via `StorageBufferNode.getHash()` global cache.
2. **`HitInfo.wrap()`** needed for `traverseBVHShadow` return value.
3. **`getMaterial()`** for proper struct-from-buffer loading (not `getDatafromStorageBuffer`).
4. **`activeIndicesRO` removed from Shade** to stay at 8 bindings — use `instanceIndex` directly.
5. **`Fn()` can't pass storage buffer nodes** to nested `Fn()` calls — must inline env IS in ShadeKernel.
6. **`.compute([count], [wgSize])`** — first arg is workgroup COUNT, not thread count.

### Storage Buffer Binding Budget
```
Scene buffers (7 total, not all used per kernel):
  bvhBuffer, triangleBuffer, materialBuffer,
  emissiveTriangleBuffer, lightBVHBuffer,
  envMarginalWeights, envConditionalWeights

NOT storage buffers (free to use):
  Light buffers (directional, area, point, spot) → uniformArray
  Texture arrays (7) → texture bindings
  Environment texture → texture binding
  All scalar/vector/matrix uniforms → uniform bindings

Shade kernel binding budget (8/8):
  mat(1) + envMarg(1) + envCond(1) + rayBuf(1) + rngBuf(1) + hitBuf(1) + shadowBuf(1) + counters(1)
```

## TODO — Ordered by Priority

### Tier 0: Quick Fixes ✅ DONE
- [x] 1. ~~Add `forceCompile()` before kernel dispatch loop~~ (skipped — not needed, kernels compile on first dispatch)
- [x] 2. Firefly suppression — `regularizePathContribution()` after NEE/emissive
- [x] 3. GI intensity scaling per-bounce
- [x] 4. Early ray termination (throughput < 0.001 after bounce 3)
- [x] 5. Delete dead code: `PathTraceKernel.js`, `BufferAccess.js`, `RayBufferPool.js`

### Tier 1: Critical BRDF + Transparency (0 extra bindings)
- [x] 6. Full Disney BRDF via `generateSampledDirection()` — specular, metallic, clearcoat lobes. Throughput uses albedo (not value/pdf) until MIS is added.
- [x] 7. Transparency — `handleMaterialTransparency()` with medium stack (RAY_STRIDE=7), refraction, Fresnel, alpha-skip
- [x] 8. Clearcoat sampling — added 2026-04-19 in ShadeKernel. Wraps the BRDF sample in `If(material.clearcoat > 0)` that calls `sampleClearcoat(ray, hitInfo, material, xi, rngState)`, else falls back to `generateSampledDirection` (original path). Verified on Pagani Huayra (40 mats, clearcoat paint): renders correctly with glossy highlights, no NaN, no new errors.
- [x] 9. MIS via `calculateIndirectLighting` + `powerHeuristic` NEE. ~80% brightness match to monolithic.

### Tier 2: Light Support (needs binding budget work)
- [x] 10. Request `maxStorageBuffersPerShaderStage: 10` — already done in `PathTracerApp.js:1116` (`Math.min(adapterLimit, 10)`). Adapter reports limit=10 on Apple Silicon; likely 8 on older hardware.
- [x] 11. Discrete light sampling (directional, point, spot) + shadow rays — already covered. ShadeKernel's `calculateDirectLightingUnified` call passes `directionalLightsBuffer/pointLightsBuffer/spotLightsBuffer` + counts; the same function the monolithic uses (LightsSampling.js:334). Shadow rays go through inline `traceShadowRay` (see item 14/15).
- [x] 12. Area light sampling — same path, `areaLightsBuffer` + `numAreaLights` plumbed through and consumed by `calculateDirectLightingUnified` with rectangular area-light solid angle sampling + MIS.
- [x] 13. Emissive triangle NEE — **implemented 2026-04-19** after main's storage-buffer packing (`d8e0bf4`) consolidated `lightBVH` + `emissive tris` into a single `lightStorageNode` binding and `envMarginal` + `envConditional` into `envCDFStorageNode`. The original blocker (binding budget) went away. The earlier "nested Fn with storage closure produces black renders" concern turned out to be unreproducible once the env CDF was unified to match the monolithic signature — `traceShadowRayWrapped = Fn(...)` closing over `bvhBuffer/triangleBuffer/materialBuffer` now compiles and runs correctly.

  Both monolithic paths ported:
  - **Light BVH fast path** (`sampleLightBVHTriangle`) when `lightBVHNodeCount > 0` — spatially-aware importance sampling with roughness-based skip for diffuse secondary bounces.
  - **Flat-CDF fallback** (`calculateEmissiveTriangleContribution`) otherwise.

  Verified on Cornell Box (2 emissive tris, 9 mats): NEE-on produces visibly cleaner shadows around the area light vs NEE-off, matching monolithic behavior. ShadeKernel bindings: 9 with `lightBuffer` (still within 10-binding limit).

### Tier 3: Shadow Quality
- [x] 14/15. **Transparent shadow transmission** — effectively already working (2026-04-19). Investigation showed `WavefrontPathTracer.render()` does NOT dispatch `connect` or `accumulate`; instead `ShadeKernel` calls `calculateDirectLightingUnified` inline, which internally calls `traceShadowRay` (from `LightsDirect.js`). That function already handles the full transparent-shadow loop: alpha-cutout (MASK/BLEND), transmissive (glass + Beer-Lambert), transparent (opacity), up to 8 iterations. **No wavefront-specific work needed** — the monolithic shadow infrastructure is reused. `ConnectKernel`/`AccumulateKernel` are dead code kept for a future deferred-shadow pipeline; if that pipeline is ever wired up, `rngBuffer` would be needed only if stochastic transparency is added (current `traceShadowRay` takes rngState but doesn't read it).

### Tier 4: Integration Testing
- [x] 16. ASVGF denoiser — temporal stability verified
- [x] 17. OIDN denoiser — verified 2026-04-19 on camera + Bistro scenes, wavefront + OIDN produces clean denoised output, no NaN/Inf in pixel sample.
- [x] 18. Tile rendering — **removed entirely** (full-frame only). TileHelper survives only for OIDN-denoise / upscale progress overlays.
- [x] 19. DOF — bokeh working, GenerateKernel DOF ray gen correct
- [x] 20. Adaptive sampling — verified 2026-04-19, stage enabled end-to-end with wavefront, texture node wired through Generate kernel, no visual regression.
- [x] 21. Debug visualization modes (visMode 1-11) — **implemented 2026-05** as `TSL/DebugKernel.js`, a single primary-ray kernel that reuses `TraceDebugMode` (`TSL/Debugger.js`) for modes 1-10, computes mode 9 (stratified jitter) inline, and routes mode 11 (NaN/Inf) through the normal pipeline + a FinalWriteKernel branch. `PathTracer.render()` dispatches it when `visMode>0` (≠11). All 12 modes live-verified.

### FIXED: Visual parity achieved
Root cause of brightness gap was 3 missing lines — material.color/metalness/roughness
were never updated with texture-sampled values after sampleAllMaterialTextures().
All BRDF functions used white/default base material instead of textured values.
Fix: apply matSamples to material struct before BRDF evaluation.
Full calculateIndirectLighting + calculateDirectLightingUnified now work correctly.

### FIXED (2026-04): TSL idiom bugs that masqueraded as material + brightness issues

After the Apr 2026 merge+re-verify pass, three related issues were found and fixed:

1. **`.and()` and `.or()` are boolean (`&&` / `||`) in TSL, not bitwise**. The packed
   hit-buffer op `matIndex.or(meshIndex.shiftLeft(16))` was collapsing to 0 or 1.
   Every hit reported `mat=1` regardless of actual material — 47-material scenes
   looked uniform white. Ray ACTIVE-bit clear (`flags.and(~ACTIVE)`) also silently
   reduced flags to 1 rather than clearing the bit. Swept `.and/.or` → `.bitAnd/.bitOr`
   in PackedRayBuffer and four wavefront kernels.

2. **JS `return;` inside a TSL `If()` callback only exits the callback**, not the
   outer Fn body. All wavefront kernels used `return;` for early-exit (inactive ray
   skip, miss-handler short-circuit, russian roulette, max-bounce, etc). The code
   AFTER each `If` kept running on rays that were supposed to be done. On miss rays,
   that meant the HIT PROCESSING block ran with `hitMatIdx=65535` (uint(-1)&0xFFFF),
   reading out-of-bounds material slots and adding garbage. The visible symptom was
   a ~+1.0 bias on the R channel of env-background pixels. Replaced all 17 sites
   with TSL's `Return()` (from `three/tsl`, via `utils/Discard.js`) which emits a
   real WGSL `return`.

3. **Secondary env-miss used hardcoded `bgScale = 2.0`** as a placeholder for
   missing MIS. ShadeKernel now reads `prevBouncePdf` from the ray buffer,
   evaluates `sampleEquirect` for the env PDF, and uses `powerHeuristic` as the
   secondary miss weight — matching PathTracerCore.

Result: Outdoor Sofaset, Pagani Huayra, and Camera all render with correct material
differentiation. Sampled pixels match monolithic within 0.001 on most points
and <3% on others (stochastic).

### Tier 5: Performance (Phase 2)
- [x] 22. Material sorting kernel — working end-to-end via storage-atomic histogram (TSL's `WorkgroupInfoNode` emits plain `array<T>`, not `array<atomic<T>>`, so workgroup atomics were not viable). Wired behind `wavefrontSortMaterials` flag (default off after benchmark). `SortKernel.js` uses `QueueManager.sortHistogram` (`numWorkgroups × 16` atomic u32). Output is bit-identical to sort-off. See items 32–35 for follow-up tuning.
- [x] 23. Performance benchmarking — **re-measured 2026-04-19 after TSL idiom fixes, then re-measured with warm-cycle methodology.** 512×512, 3 bounces, 60 samples.

  **IMPORTANT methodological note**: first 60-frame cycle after a scene load or page reload is slowed 20–40% by shader compilation, JIT warmup, and cold GPU caches. Earlier measurements in this file (marked "cold" or pre-2026-04-19) were polluted by this overhead. **Use warm-cycle median** (median of 3 runs, each after an `app.reset()`, discarding the first load cycle) as the steady-state truth.

  **Warm-cycle steady-state (median of 3 reruns, 2026-04-19):**

  | Scene | Tris | Monolithic | WF sort OFF | WF sort ON (no guard) | WF sort ON (indirect) |
  |---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
  | Camera | 18,016 | 0.49s | — | 0.64s | 0.59s |
  | Cornell Box 1 | 64 | 0.83s | — | 0.67s | 0.67s |
  | Ferrari | 34,050 | 0.76s | — | 1.00s | 0.99s |
  | Helmet | 15,484 | 0.58s | — | 0.83s | 0.82s |
  | Modern Bathroom | 187,188 | 1.57s | — | 1.19s | 1.19s |
  | Pagani Huayra | 291,017 | 1.83s | — | 1.83s | 1.85s |
  | Outdoor Sofaset | 268,901 | 1.64s | — | 1.65s | 1.66s |

  **Findings:**

  1. **Wavefront vs monolithic (warm, sort ON)**: wavefront wins on 2 scenes (Cornell −19%, Modern Bathroom −24%), loses on 3 (Camera +20%, Ferrari +30%, Helmet +41%), ties on 2 (Pagani, Sofaset). The cold-cycle "4/6 wins" was misleading because cold-cycle shader compile dominates both engines similarly.

  2. **Why the simple/complex split**: wavefront dispatches ~15 kernels per frame (resetCounters, generate, initActiveIndices, extend, resetHist, sort, shade, resetActive, compact per bounce, finalWrite). Each has launch overhead. Monolithic is 1 big dispatch. When GPU is warm, per-frame launch cost dominates simple scenes; per-ray shading work dominates complex scenes. Wavefront only wins when coherence benefits exceed per-frame launch overhead.

  3. **Indirect dispatch (32b) vs plain sort (no guard) is a wash on warm cycles.** Slight help on Camera (−8%), essentially identical elsewhere (±1%). The 10-20% "wins" I saw in cold benchmarks were cold-cycle compile overhead that amortized away. The dispatch-overhead argument for indirect is mostly theoretical for our scene sizes at 512×512/3 bounces.

  4. **Wavefront-as-default (item 31) is not justified on this data.** The cold-cycle interpretation suggested it; the warm-cycle numbers show wavefront is a specialized optimization for dense/coherent scenes, not a general-purpose replacement. Keep it flagged, recommend per-scene profiling.

  **Default `wavefrontSortMaterials` remains ON**: sort ON is equal to or better than sort OFF on all tested scenes at warm steady-state, and it's the production-standard pattern.

- [ ] 24. Prefix-sum compaction
- [~] 25. Half-precision buffers — **investigated, deferred** 2026-04-19.

  **Goal**: cut GPU bandwidth between kernels (the dominant wavefront cost per the Bistro profile).

  **Precision analysis**:
  | Field | Current | f16 safe? | Notes |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | origin | f32×3 | NO | world-space position, precision critical for BVH |
  | direction | f32×3 | YES | unit vector, bounded ±1 |
  | flags | u32 | N/A | bit ops need full width |
  | throughput | f32×3 | MAYBE | HDR scenes can exceed f16 max (65504) |
  | pdf | f32 | NO | very small values, f16 underflows |
  | radiance | f32×3 | NO | HDR; emissive samples routinely >65504 |
  | hit normal | f32×3 | YES | unit vector, octahedral encoding |
  | hit uv (tex) | f32×2 | YES | in [0,1] |
  | hit dist | f32 | NO | range critical |
  | matIdx/meshIdx | u32×2 | MAYBE | meshIdx can exceed 256 on large scenes |
  | MRT albedo/normal/depth | f32×4 | YES | bounded, per-pixel once |
  | IOR stack | f32 | YES | range [1, 2.5] |

  **Bandwidth math**: ray buffer is ~112 B/ray × 1M rays = 112 MB, read/written by 4-5 kernels per bounce → 500-700 MB/bounce. Hit buffer ~32 B/hit × 1M = 32 MB × 3 kernels = ~100 MB/bounce. Ray buffer is 5-7× the hit buffer. Real savings require compacting the RAY buffer, not just hit.

  **Blocker**: the biggest-win packing (HIT_STRIDE 2→1 for 50% hit savings) requires fitting `dist(f32) + triIdx(u32) + packedUV(u32) + packedNormal+matIdx+meshIdx(u32)` into 16 bytes. That forces matIdx+meshIdx into ≤16 bits combined. Current code uses 16+16 = 32. Squeezing to 8+8 caps meshes at 256, which fails on large scenes (Bistro is borderline). Without a design for a scene-dependent meshIdx encoding (e.g., a CPU-side remap like item 41 but for meshes), this isn't safe to ship.

  **Path forward** (not this session):
  1. Add mesh-ID remap (dense per-scene, analogous to item 41 for materials) so meshIdx fits u8.
  2. Compact hit buffer to HIT_STRIDE=1 with octahedral normal + packed uv + matIdx/meshIdx.
  3. Benchmark; if promising, extend to packing direction/albedo/normal in the ray buffer's MRT slots.
  4. Keep origin/radiance/throughput/pdf at f32.

  Not shipped today because the design requires dedicated validation across scenes and the partial measures (packing without stride reduction) don't save bandwidth.

  **Attempted and reverted 2026-04-19** (post–main merge):
  - Implemented full HIT_STRIDE 2→1 compaction with octahedral-u8×u8 normal + packHalf2x16 UV + 8-bit matIdx + 8-bit meshIdx = 32 bits in `.w` of a single vec4.
  - Visually correct on Camera + Pagani (no normal banding on glossy paint — anisotropic texture filtering masks 2° encoding error).
  - **Perf impact: noise floor.** Camera 512/3b warm: 719ms with HIT_STRIDE=1 vs 720ms with HIT_STRIDE=2. Pagani 512/8b warm: 1715ms vs ~1700ms.
  - **Diagnosis**: modern GPU L1/L2 caches handle the 32-byte hit struct fine, and one cache line (128 B) covers 4 hits either way. Halving stride doesn't improve cache hit rate — it just moves data in bigger batches.
  - **Lesson for item 25 broadly**: wavefront's measured GPU-bound cost is not total-bytes-moved but **pipeline-barrier and memory-latency** related. Compacting formats doesn't reduce barrier cost. To actually attack the bottleneck, we need fewer kernel boundaries (item 45 persistent threads) — not smaller data per kernel.
  - Reverted. Infrastructure (octahedral encode/decode helpers) discarded; can be resurrected from git if needed.
- [x] 26. **Async readback for dynamic dispatch** — implemented 2026-04-19.

  **Mechanism**:
  1. QueueManager exposes `counters` + per-bounce snapshot buffer (`MAX_BOUNCE_SNAPSHOTS=32` u32 slots).
  2. After each bounce's compact, a 1-thread `snapshotBounceCount` kernel copies `atomicLoad(ACTIVE_RAY_COUNT)` into `bounceCounts[currentBounce]`.
  3. Once per ~4 frames, `WavefrontPathTracer._maybeReadbackCounters()` fires `renderer.getArrayBufferAsync(bounceCountsAttr)`. Resolves async (no GPU stall).
  4. Next frame, the bounce loop consults `_lastBounceCounts[bounce]` AFTER each compact; if survivors ≤ threshold (default 2000, ~1% of primary rays), it `break`s out, skipping remaining bounces.

  **Warm-bench 512/8b (Camera scene, early-exit on vs off):**

  | Config | ms / 60f | bounceCounts observed |
  |---|---:|---|
  | Early-exit OFF (threshold=-1) | 1240 | 82K, 18K, 4K, 100, 24, 9, 6, 3 |
  | Early-exit ON (threshold=2000) | **722** | 82K, 18K, 4K, 100, 0, 0, 0, 0 |

  **Saves 42% on open scenes with aggressive ray death** (Camera). Verified visually identical output. Cornell Box (enclosed) and Pagani also render correctly — item 26 doesn't break them, just provides less headroom.

  **Why it works**: WebGPU workgroup launches have fixed overhead. Dispatching 4000 workgroups where only ~5 threads have work is wasteful — they each hit `If(tid >= activeCount) Return()` quickly but the launch cost is paid. Early-exit skips the dispatch entirely.

  **Caveat**: threshold is a heuristic. Too high → darkens scene by dropping real light; too low → few savings. 2000 (~1% of 262K primary rays) chosen empirically. Could be made per-scene adaptive if needed.

  **Contrast with item 32b (indirect dispatch)**: indirect dispatch sizes a single kernel's workgroups based on live count; item 26 decides whether to DISPATCH AT ALL for late bounces. Complementary — 32b attacks per-workgroup overhead, 26 attacks whole-bounce overhead. 32b was net-zero at 512/3b; 26 is +42% at 512/8b because the longer bounce tail amplifies the wasted-dispatch cost.

### Tier 5b: Sort follow-ups (ordered by dependency, 2026-04)

### How production GPU renderers handle this
(Context for why our sort design is a proof of concept, not a destination.)

- **Indirect dispatch is standard**. OptiX, DXR, pbrt-v4 GPU, Cycles GPU all size sort/trace/shade dispatches to the live ray queue count via indirect dispatch, not a fixed max. "Launch 1024 WGs and skip most of them" isn't a production pattern.
- **Material sort is usually global radix**, not per-workgroup counting. Radix over a packed 32-bit key (material ID + hit geom hash, sometimes direction) gives cross-workgroup coherence and doesn't clamp on bin count. CUB / onesweep on CUDA; WebGPU is catching up.
- **Histograms live in workgroup-shared memory**. We can't do that yet because TSL's `WorkgroupInfoNode` doesn't emit `atomic<T>` element type — confirmed earlier in this branch. We fall back to storage-atomic histograms, which is slower and why the counting-sort approach is underperforming. When TSL gains workgroup atomics, revisit.
- **Persistent threads / work-stealing** are another common pattern — threads pull work from a global queue, self-balancing across material classes without an explicit sort. Larger refactor.
- **CPU path tracers don't sort** — material coherence is a GPU-SIMT problem.

**Completed this cycle:**
- [x] 36. ~~Sofaset outlier investigation~~ — resolved by enabling sort. Sort brings Sofaset from +86% to +19% vs monolithic, confirming the outlier was material-divergence-driven, not BLAS/emissive-driven.
- [x] 37. ~~Re-run sort ON/OFF benchmark~~ — done 2026-04-19 (see item 23 table).
- [~] 33. ~~Raise MAX_BINS statically~~ — benchmarked 16/32/64, result was mixed. Only Sofaset wins (−13%); Pagani regresses 29%. The scan cost scales linearly with MAX_BINS and is paid unconditionally by every workgroup, so raising bins is only a win if actual material diversity exploits them. Kept at 16.
- [~] 32a. ~~Early-exit guard on empty workgroups~~ **(attempted, reverted)**. Wrapped `If(wgBase < activeCount)` around phase gates. Two issues surfaced:
  1. Putting `storageBarrier()` inside a branch conditioned on `atomicLoad` fails WGSL uniformity analysis (atomicLoad is considered possibly-non-uniform). First attempt silently failed compilation; produced black renders that timed fast because no work ran.
  2. The WGSL-safe rewrite (barriers always called, only work-phase gated per thread with `.and(wgActive)`) produced a **net +4.3% regression** across 6 scenes. Only Sofaset (−5%) and Modern Bathroom (−1%) benefited; Helmet regressed +13%, Cornell +8%, Ferrari +4%, Pagani +7%. The "savings" were small (thread 0 of empty WGs skipping a 16-iter scan on zeros ≈ ~13K atomic ops/bounce) and dwarfed by the per-thread cost of the extra `.and(wgActive)` check run by every thread in every WG.
  **Lesson**: the right pattern is "don't launch the workgroup" (32b), not "launch and early-return". 32a's premise was correct; forcing it into WGSL-compliant shape broke its cost/benefit math.

**Prerequisite phase — do these FIRST, in this order:**

- [~] 32b/40. **Indirect dispatch attempted, net-zero on warm cycles.** Prototype lives in working tree (uncommitted): IndirectStorageBufferAttribute in QueueManager, prepSortDispatch kernel in WavefrontPathTracer, Sort registered with indirect attr. Three.js supports this fully (`IndirectStorageBufferAttribute` → `dispatchWorkgroupsIndirect`). Implementation is correct, renders match monolithic exactly. But warm-cycle benchmark shows only Camera benefits (−8%); all other scenes are ±1% vs no-guard. The prep kernel's own launch overhead roughly offsets the empty-workgroup savings at 512×512/3 bounces. Might be worth keeping at higher resolutions or higher bounce counts where empty-workgroup count grows (item 35 will tell). For now: keep stashed, not a general win.

- [x] 41. **Material ID remapping** — implemented 2026-04-19. GeometryExtractor tracks per-material triangle count; SceneProcessor forwards it; MaterialDataManager builds a `remap[declaredMatIdx] → denseBinIdx` table by sorting materials by triangle count (descending) and assigning bin = rank position. SortKernel reads `remap[matIdx].clamp(0, MAX_BINS-1)` instead of raw `matIdx.clamp`, so the long tail of rarely-used materials collapses into bin 15 while frequently-used ones get exclusive bins. Gated at `materialCount > 32` (below that, direct clamp is already ≥ 50% coverage and the extra storage-buffer read dominates the coherence gain — Bathroom 24-mat experiment showed +5% regression without gate).

  **Warm-bench gains (512×512, 3 bounces):**

  | Scene | Mats | Before (direct clamp) | After (remap) | Delta |
  |---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
  | Pagani | 40 | 1830 ms / 60f | 1699 ms | **−7%** |
  | Sofaset | 47 | 1650 ms | 1531 ms | **−7%** |
  | Bathroom | 24 | 1190 ms | 1247 ms (remap bypassed) | n/a |

  Even heavier wins expected on Bistro (132 mats, 10× dense-tail overflow) — not verified due to pre-existing texture-OOM loading bug on that scene. Revisit Item 42 (MAX_BINS=32/64 re-bench) now that remap makes dense scenes actually benefit from more bins.

**Re-measure phase:**

- [x] 42. **Re-bench MAX_BINS at 16/32/64** — done 2026-04-19. Parametrized via `ENGINE_DEFAULTS.wavefrontSortBins` (read by `SortKernel`, `QueueManager`, `MaterialDataManager`). Warm-bench 512/3b:

  | Scene | Mats | 16 + remap | 32 no-remap (gated) | Delta |
  |---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
  | Pagani | 40 | 1699 ms | 1996 ms | **+17%** |
  | Sofaset | 47 | 1531 ms | 1979 ms | **+29%** |

  Raising bins **regresses on the tested scenes**. Two reasons:
  1. Phase-2 scan cost scales linearly with MAX_BINS (thread 0 per workgroup loops N iterations); 32 bins doubles the serial scan work on EVERY workgroup regardless of active count.
  2. At 32 bins, 40-47 material scenes fall below the remap gate (`materialCount > 2×MAX_BINS = 64`), so the dense-material coherence win from item 41 doesn't fire.

  Could potentially win with (a) lower remap threshold at higher bin counts, (b) Bistro-class scenes with >64 materials. Not pursued — the 16+remap combo is the production optimum for current benchmark suite. **Default stays at 16.**

**Only if items 32b/41 don't fully close the gap:**

- [~] 39. **Adaptive bin count via uniform** — **superseded by items 38+41+42**. Threshold analysis after those landed:
  - Scenes with ≤8 materials skip sort entirely (item 38) — no bin count needed.
  - Scenes with 9-16 materials: direct clamp `matIdx.clamp(0,15)` is already exact, remap bypassed (item 41 gate). Adaptive bins would shave at most 7 scan iterations per workgroup — sub-percent impact.
  - Scenes with >16 materials: capped at 16 anyway (item 42 showed raising MAX_BINS regresses, so dynamic = static).
  Net actionable range for adaptive bins is 0 materials. Not implemented.
- [x] 38. **Skip Sort dispatch when materialCount is very low** — implemented 2026-04-19. `_buildWavefrontKernels` sets `this._sortMaterials = flag && matCount > 8`. Sort + resetSortHistogram kernels aren't registered when sort is off, and the bounce loop gates on the flag. Verified: camera (2 mats) skips sort, Ferrari (7 mats) skips sort, Pagani (40 mats) runs sort. Ferrari warm is unchanged (~1.03s / 60f at 512/3b) — the ~3% sort overhead is at the noise floor at this resolution. Gain is cleaner rather than fast.

**Larger phase-2 improvements (closer to production designs):**

- [x] 34. **Global counting sort** — implemented and benched 2026-04-19, shipped behind `ENGINE_DEFAULTS.wavefrontSortGlobal` (default `false`). Three-kernel pipeline in `SortGlobalKernels.js`: histogram → prefix-sum → scatter. Produces correct global material ordering (visually verified on Pagani).

  **Warm-bench 512/3b:**

  | Scene | Mats | Per-WG + remap | Global sort | Delta |
  |---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
  | Pagani | 40 | 1699 ms | 1999 ms | **+18%** |
  | Sofaset | 47 | 1531 ms | 1984 ms | **+30%** |

  **Why global loses**:
  1. Four dispatches (reset/hist/prefix/scatter) vs one — GPU pipeline barriers between each.
  2. Global atomic contention across all workgroups on the shared 16-bin histogram (per-WG version's atomics stay within a workgroup).
  3. Serial prefix-sum (single thread) becomes a sync point.
  4. Consistent with earlier per-kernel CPU-profile finding: wavefront is **memory/barrier bound on GPU**, not shader-divergence bound — so buying more coherence with more dispatches is a bad trade.

  Kept as opt-in flag for future re-eval if (a) scenes grow past 64-128 materials where radix bucketing matters more, or (b) we gain subgroup ops (item 44) that amortize prefix-sum across threads. Full 32-bit radix (multiple passes for material + geometry hash) not worth pursuing until per-WG runs out of room.
- [ ] 43. **Parallel prefix scan + workgroup-shared histogram** (inside current counting-sort design). Replace the O(MAX_BINS) serial scan done by thread 0 with an O(log MAX_BINS) parallel scan using `var<workgroup>: array<atomic<u32>, N>`. **Blocked on TSL gaining atomic workgroup memory** — current `workgroupArray('uint')` emits plain `array<u32>` rather than `array<atomic<u32>>`, so any workgroup-local atomic scan fails WGSL validation. When upstream TSL lands this, sort overhead drops substantially.
- [ ] 44. **Subgroup ops (ballot / shuffle) for in-subgroup reordering**. Some renderers skip the explicit sort pass and use subgroup extensions to rearrange threads within a 32/64-thread subgroup on the fly. Requires WebGPU subgroups (Chrome shipping but experimental).
- [ ] 45. **Persistent threads / work-stealing**. Threads pull work from a global atomic queue instead of being pre-assigned. Load-balances across material classes without an explicit sort. Larger architectural change.
- [~] 35. **Re-benchmark at 8 bounces and 1024×1024 resolution** — partial (Bistro only, 2026-04-19). Coherence wins compound on longer paths and larger sample pools; 3-bounce/512² may be understating the benefit.

  **Blocker encountered & fixed**: wavefront rendered only the top-left 512×512 region when resolution was raised via UI. Root cause: `PathTracer.setSize()` updated storage textures but WavefrontPathTracer never rebuilt kernels, so `_wfRenderWidth/Height/MaxRayCount` uniforms and `_packedBuffers`/`_queueManager` sizes stayed at old dimensions. Generate's bounds check silently dropped rays outside the stale window. Fix: override `setSize()` and `_handleResize()` in WavefrontPathTracer to call `_buildWavefrontKernels()` on size change.

  **Stress test — 1024×1024, 8 bounces, warm-cycle median of 3 runs:**

  | Scene | Tris | Mats | Monolithic | Wavefront | Regression |
  |---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
  | Bistro | 2.83M | 132 | 91.7 ms/f | 147.4 ms/f | **+61%** |
  | Sponza | 262K | 26 | 32.7 ms/f | 62.2 ms/f | **+90%** |

  Warm runs are tightly reproducible (Bistro: 8842/8966/8838ms for 60 frames; Sponza: 3734/3735/3733ms). Cold-cycle (first load) adds 25–30% overhead from shader compile and must be discarded.

  **Counter-intuitive finding**: *simpler* Sponza regresses MORE than *complex* Bistro. Wavefront's fixed per-frame architectural overhead (dispatches, barriers, kernel-boundary I/O) dominates proportionally when monolithic's per-ray work is light. Wavefront becomes relatively less bad as ray complexity grows — the opposite of the "complex scenes benefit from coherence" hypothesis.

  Sort adds only ~2% on Bistro (user-tested, sort OFF: 8.30s vs sort ON: 8.46s).

  **Findings:**
  1. **Wavefront regresses ~50% on a dense, material-diverse, complex scene at high res/bounces.** The "coherence wins on complex scenes" hypothesis did NOT hold for Bistro — the opposite of what item 35 was meant to confirm.
  2. **Sort overhead is tiny (~2%)** even with 132 materials cycling through 16 bins. Item 41 (material ID remap) will not recover more than ~2% of the gap on this scene.
  3. **Real cost is per-bounce kernel launch + buffer I/O**: 5 kernels × 9 bounces = 45 dispatches, each round-tripping ray state through packed storage buffers. Monolithic does this in fused registers.
  4. **Scenes where wavefront could still win** are ones where ray divergence produces big shading-work-per-ray differences that coherence groups meaningfully reduce — not where ray shading is already uniform-enough that dispatch overhead wins.
  5. Until kernel fusion or indirect dispatch-driven queue shrinkage (late-bounce workgroup culling) lands, **wavefront is a net loss at production resolutions and bounce counts**. Defer item 31 (wavefront-as-default) indefinitely.

  **Per-kernel CPU-submission profile (Bistro, sort ON, 60 frames, 2026-04-19):**

  | Kernel | Calls | CPU ms | Avg/call |
  |---|---:|---:|---:|
  | shade | 540 | 14.59 | 0.027 |
  | resetCounters | 60 | 6.46 | 0.108 |
  | extend | 540 | 6.27 | 0.012 |
  | compact | 540 | 5.87 | 0.011 |
  | sort | 540 | 4.96 | 0.009 |
  | resetSortHistogram | 540 | 4.94 | 0.009 |
  | resetActiveCounter | 540 | 4.67 | 0.009 |
  | generate | 60 | 3.86 | 0.064 |
  | finalWrite | 60 | 1.15 | 0.019 |
  | initActiveIndices | 60 | 1.00 | 0.017 |
  | **TOTAL** | 3480 | **53.78** | |

  CPU dispatch cost is **0.54% of wall time** (53.78ms CPU / 9992ms wall). Per frame: 0.9ms CPU, 165.6ms GPU. Wavefront is fully GPU-bound on Bistro.

  This rules out "per-bounce kernel launch overhead" as the cause of regression — submission is essentially free. The GPU cost is pipeline barriers between 50 dispatches/frame and ray state round-tripping through VRAM. Kernel fusion and half-precision ray state are the only knobs with enough leverage.

  **Vite HMR gotcha**: editing `EngineDefaults.js` mid-session caused `WavefrontPathTracer` to see stale `wavefrontSortMaterials: false` even though the file had `true`. Reloading with `?bust=<n>` query on the URL forced Vite to re-parse the module. Any future dev-time benchmarking that toggles defaults should use a fresh URL, not just Cmd-Shift-R.

  **Per-kernel profiler usage** (added 2026-04-19 to `WavefrontKernelManager`):
  ```js
  const km = window.app.stages.pathTracer._kernelManager;
  km.enableProfiling(true);
  window.app.reset();
  // ... run some frames ...
  console.table(km.getProfileReport());
  km.enableProfiling(false);
  ```
  Measures CPU submission time only (GPU work is async and NOT included). For GPU timing, use stats-gl's existing `gpuQueries` or add timestamp queries via `device.queryType: 'timestamp'`.

  **Kernel fusion test — Fused ExtendShade is slower than separate on Bistro (2026-04-19):**

  | Config | ms/frame | vs monolithic |
  |---|---:|---:|
  | Monolithic | 91.7 | baseline |
  | Separate extend + shade (sort OFF) | 160.4 | +75% |
  | Separate extend + sort + shade | 166.5 | +82% |
  | **Fused extendShade** | **192.1** | **+109%** |

  Visually correct — no pink-tint bug (TSL idiom fixes resolved it). But fusion **regresses 15–20%** vs separate kernels. Inverts the "fusion = win" hypothesis.

  **Why fusion loses**: register pressure kills occupancy. The fused kernel holds BVH traversal state + material struct + texture samples + shading state all in registers simultaneously, so fewer threads fit per SM, fewer workgroups are in flight, less latency hiding. Small focused kernels (extend-only, shade-only) each have lower register footprint and run at higher occupancy. The inter-kernel I/O cost is real but smaller than the occupancy loss from fusion.

  **Obsolete comment**: remove the `// Separate Extend + Shade (fused kernel has pink tint bug on multi-material scenes)` comment in `WavefrontPathTracer.render()` — the bug is gone and fusion is slower anyway, so the separate path is the performance choice, not a workaround.

  **Implications**:
  1. Item 25 (half-precision buffers) — still worth trying, reduces I/O without register pressure
  2. Item 45 (persistent threads) — keeps state in registers across bounces without fusion's occupancy cost
  3. Kernel fusion is **not a generally useful lever** on our shader graph; the default separate-kernel pipeline is already the right shape. Focus optimization elsewhere.

### Tier 6: Full Parity + Migration
- [x] 27. Displacement mapping in Shade — added 2026-04-19. Imports `refineDisplacedIntersection` + `DisplacementResult` from `../Displacement.js`, reads `hitTriangleIndex` from the hit buffer, constructs a minimal `HitInfo` struct, and gates the marcher on `material.displacementMapIndex >= 0 && displacementScale > 0`. Refined UV is used for `sampleAllMaterialTextures`, and displaced-normal blends with the texture normal (matches `PathTracerCore:783`). `displacementMaps` texture array wired through `_wfTexNodes` for hot-swap on model change. Non-displaced scenes (camera, bathroom) verified unchanged.
- [x] 28. Medium stack persistence across bounces — already working. ShadeKernel reads the 3-slot IOR stack from the ray buffer at each bounce, transitions on enter/exit transmission, and writes back. Generate initializes depth=0, ior=1.0. Verified on Diamond at 8 bounces / 8 transmissive — produces correct refraction + internal reflection.
- [~] 29. Path importance caching — **not applicable to wavefront architecture**. The monolithic caches classification / BRDF weights / material cache across bounces within a single full-path trace in one kernel invocation. Wavefront decomposes each bounce into a separate ShadeKernel dispatch, so the cache would have to be persisted through the ray buffer at +~32 bytes/ray (for 1024² = ~32 MB extra) and rebuilt whenever `materialIndex` changes — the common case for dense scenes. Intra-bounce caching (within one ShadeKernel invocation) has limited leverage because `generateSampledDirection` is called once per ray; `calculateDirectLightingUnified` and `calculateIndirectLighting` don't expose the same cache parameters. Revisit if indirect/direct paths are refactored to accept external caches.
- [x] 30. Spec status updated 2026-04-19 — `docs/specs/wavefront-path-tracing.md` header now reflects "Implemented (experimental, opt-in)" with the actual perf envelope and limitation list.
- [~] 31. Remove monolithic fallback — **NOT justified** by measured data. Wavefront regresses at 1024/8b (Bistro +54-61%, Sponza +90%) because of GPU-side memory/barrier overhead on ray-state I/O between kernels. Keep both paths; the monolithic remains the production default. Revisit only if one of the blocked TSL/WebGPU dependencies (workgroup atomics, subgroups) unlocks a fundamentally different architecture.

## How to Resume

1. `git checkout feature/wavefront-path-tracing`
2. Set `wavefrontEnabled: true` in `src/Constants.js`
3. `npm run dev` → opens on localhost
4. The wavefront renders with env IS + shadowed NEE (overexposed due to missing MIS)
5. Start with Tier 0 quick fixes, then Tier 1 BRDF

### To test GPU infrastructure:
```js
// In browser console:
await window.__wavefrontTests(window.renderer)
// Runs 4 tests: atomics, cross-dispatch R/W, memory, vec4 access
```

### To verify kernel timing:
```js
// In browser console:
const { getApp } = await import('/src/core/appProxy.js');
const km = getApp().pathTracingStage._kernelManager;
console.table(km.getTimingReport());
```
